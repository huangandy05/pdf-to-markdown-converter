### **Code Review by Developers**

![](http://localhost:8000/api/lessons/Week_1/files/1.intro/images/_page_6_Figure_1.jpeg)

**A large project (e.g., consists of millions of lines of code) is almost impossible to be manually checked by human :**

- **!" intractable due to potentially unbounded number of paths that must be analyze**
- **!" undecidable in the presence of dynamically allocated memory and recursive data structures**

### **How about real-world large programs?**

**Whole-Program CFG of** twolf **(20.5K lines of code)**

![](http://localhost:8000/api/lessons/Week_1/files/1.intro/images/_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

#functions: 194

#pointers: 20773 #loads/stores: 8657 Costly to reason about flow of values on CFGs!

### **How about real-world large programs?**

**Call Graph of** gcc **(230.5K lines of code)**

### **Automated Code Analysis and Verification**

Automatically analyzing and assuring the behavior of computer programs regarding a property such as correctness, robustness, safety and liveness.

- **Software Analysis** (Week 1-3, Assignment 1)
	- Aim to *find the existence of bugs* (If a path exists where a bug may be triggered, report that bug)
- **Software Verification** (Week 4-5,7-10, Assignments 2 and 3)
	- Aim to *prove the absence of bugs* (For all paths, user specification should be satisfied and no bug should be triggered)

### **Automated Code Analysis and Verification**

- Software analysis and verification are useful for proving the correctness, safety and security of a program, and a key aspect of testing can execute as expected.
	- "Have we made what we were trying to make?"
		- Are we building the system right?
		- Does our design meet the user expectations?
		- Does the implementation conform to the specifications?

### **Why Software Analysis and Verification?**

- Better quality in terms of more secure and reliable software
	- Help reduce the chances of system failures and crashes
	- Cut down the number of defects found during the later stages of development
	- Rule out the existence of any backdoor vulnerability to bypass a program's authentication
- Reduce time to market
	- Less time for debugging.
	- Less time for later phase testing and bug fixing
- Consistent with user expectations/specifications
	- Assist the team in developing a software product that conforms to the specified requirements
	- Help get a better understanding of (legacy) parts of a software product

### **What Types of Analysis/Verification We Have?**

Code verification vs design verification

- **Design approach**: analyzing and verifying the design of a software system.
	- Design specs: specification languages for components of a system. For example,
		- Z language for business requirements,
		- Promela for Communicating Sequential Processes
		- B method based on Abstract Machine Notation.
		- Specification Language (VDM-SL)
		- . . .

- **Code approach**: verifying correctness of source code (**This course**)
	- Code specs (e.g., return a sorted list and free of memory errors):
		- Assertions and pre/postconditions in Hoare logic (design by contract)
		- Passing user-provided test cases
		- No crashes and free of memory errors
		- . . .

Prove or disprove the correctness of your code against the specifications via

- **Dynamic approach** (Checking code behavior during program execution)
	- **Per path verification** which aims to find bugs by exercising one execution path a time based on specific testing inputs
		- **Stress testing**
		- **Model-based testing**
		- **Fuzz testing**

### **Memory Leaks (A Vulnerable Example)**

A memory leak occurs when dynamically allocated memory is never freed along a program execution path.

### **Memory Leaks (A Vulnerable Example)**

A memory leak occurs when dynamically allocated memory is never freed along a program execution path.

```
1 typedef struct Node {
2 int data;
3 struct Node *next;
4 } Node;
5 typedef struct List {
6 struct Node *head;
7 } List;
8
9 List* create_list(int num){
10 List* list = new List();
11 list->head = new Node();
12 Node* current = list->head;
13 for(i = 0; i < num - 1; i++){
14 current = new Node();
15 current = current->next;
16 }
17 return list;
18 }
```

```
1 void free_list(List *l) {
2 Node* current = l->head;
3 while (current != NULL) {
4 node *next = current->next;
5 delete current;
6 current = next;
7 }
8 }
9
10 int main(){
11 List* l = create_list(10); // create a list of 10 nodes
12 // ... do something with the list
13 free_list(l); // deallocate the memory for the list
14 }
```
### **Memory Leaks (A Vulnerable Example)**

A memory leak occurs when dynamically allocated memory is never freed along a program execution path.

```
1 typedef struct Node {
2 int data;
3 struct Node *next;
4 } Node;
5 typedef struct List {
6 struct Node *head;
7 } List;
8
9 List* create_list(int num){
10 List* list = new List();
11 list->head = new Node();
12 Node* current = list->head;
13 for(i = 0; i < num - 1; i++){
14 current = new Node();
15 current = current->next;
16 }
17 return list;
18 }
```

```
1 void free_list(List *l) {
2 Node* current = l->head;
3 while (current != NULL) {
4 node *next = current->next;
5 delete current;
6 current = next;
7 }
8 }
9
10 int main(){
11 List* l = create_list(10); // create a list of 10 nodes
12 // ... do something with the list
13 free_list(l); // deallocate the memory for the list
14 }
```
Do we have a bug in the above code? If so, how do we fix the bug?

### **Null Pointer Dereferences (A Vulnerable Example)**

A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.

```
1 struct Student{
2 int id;
3 char* name;
4 } Student;
5 Student students[10]= {...};
6
7 Student* findStuRecord(int sID){
8 for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
9 if(students[i].id == sID)
10 return &students[i];
11 }
12 return nullptr;
13 }
```

```
1 int main(int argc, char **argv){
2 int stuID;
3 scanf( "%d%c", &stuID);
4 Student* student = findStuRecord(stuID);
5 printf("%s\n", student->name);
6 }
```
### **Null Pointer Dereferences (A Vulnerable Example)**

A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.

```
1 struct Student{
2 int id;
3 char* name;
4 } Student;
5 Student students[10]= {...};
6
7 Student* findStuRecord(int sID){
8 for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
9 if(students[i].id == sID)
10 return &students[i];
11 }
12 return nullptr;
13 }
```

```
1 int main(int argc, char **argv){
2 int stuID;
3 scanf( "%d%c", &stuID);
4 Student* student = findStuRecord(stuID);
5 printf("%s\n", student->name);
6 }
```
Do we have a bug in the above code? If so, where should we put the assertion to stop the bug?

### **Null Pointer Dereferences (A Secure Example)**

A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.

```
1 struct Student{
2 int id;

6
7 Student* findStuRecord(int sID){
8 for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
9 if(students[i].id == sID)
10 return &students[i];
11 }
12 return NULL;
13 }
```

```
1 int main(int argc, char **argv){
2 int stuID;
3 scanf( "%d%c", &stuID);
4 Student* student = findStuRecord(stuID);
5 assert(student!=nullptr);
6 printf("%s\n", student->name);
7 }
```
### **Dangling references and use-after-frees**

Dangling references are references that do not resolve to a valid memory object (e.g., caused by a use-after-free).

![](http://localhost:8000/api/lessons/Week_1/files/1.intro/images/_page_40_Figure_2.jpeg)

### **Dangling References / Use-After-Frees (A Vulnerable Example)**

Dangling references are references that do not resolve to a valid memory object (e.g., caused by a use-after-free).

```
1 char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);
2 ...
3 if (err) {
4 abrt = 1;
5 free(ptr);
6 }
7 ...
8 if (abrt) {
9 logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);
10 }
```
Do we have a bug in the above code? If so, how should we fix the bug?

### **Dangling References / Use-After-Frees (A Vulnerable Example)**

Dangling references and wild references are references that do not resolve to a valid destination

```
1 char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);
2 ...
3 if (err) {
4 abrt = 1;
5 free(ptr);
6 ptr = nullptr;
7 }
8 ...
9 if (abrt) {
10 assert(ptr != nullptr);
11 logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);
12 }
```
### **Buffer Overflows**

A buffer overflow occurs when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer, so that the program attempting to write the data to the buffer overwrites adjacent memory locations.

![](http://localhost:8000/api/lessons/Week_1/files/1.intro/images/_page_43_Figure_2.jpeg)

### **Buffer Overflows (A Vulnerable Example)**

A buffer overflow occurs when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer, so that the program attempting to write the data to the buffer overwrites adjacent memory locations.

```
1 void bufferRead() {
2 int n = 0;
3 int ret = scanf("%d", &n);
4 if (ret != 1 || n > 100) {
5 return;
6 }
7 char *p = (char *)malloc(n);
8 int y = n;
9 if (p == NULL) return;
10 p[y] = 'a';
11 free(p);
12 }
```
Do we have a bug in the above code? If so, where is the bug?

An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of digits – either higher than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.

An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of digits – either higher than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.

Typical binary register widths for **unsigned integers** include

- 4 bits: maximum representable value 2<sup>4</sup> - 1 = 15
- 8 bits: maximum representable value 2<sup>8</sup> - 1 = 255
- 16 bits: maximum representable value 2<sup>16</sup> 1 = 65,535
- 32 bits: maximum representable value 2<sup>32</sup> 1 = 4,294,967,295 (the most common width for personal computers as of 2005),
- 64 bits: maximum representable value 2<sup>64</sup> 1 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (the most common width for personal computer CPUs, as of 2017),
- 128 bits: maximum representable value 2<sup>128</sup> 1 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,455

In C/C++, overflows of **signed integer** will cause **undefined behavior**. Overflows of **unsigned integer** will cause a **wraparound**. For unsigned integers, when the value exceeds the maximum value (2*<sup>n</sup>* for some *n*), the result is reduced to that value modulo 2*<sup>n</sup>* .

Here are some of C's various integer types and the values (in standard library):

- INT MIN (the minimum value for an integer): -2,147,483,648 bits
- INT MAX (the maximum value for an integer): +2,147,483,647 bits
- UINT MAX (the maximum value for an unsigned integer): 4,294,967,295 bits

In C/C++, overflows of **signed integer** will cause **undefined behavior**. Overflows of **unsigned integer** will cause a **wraparound**. For unsigned integers, when the value exceeds the maximum value (2*<sup>n</sup>* for some *n*), the result is reduced to that value modulo 2*<sup>n</sup>* .

Here are some of C's various integer types and the values (in standard library):

- INT MIN (the minimum value for an integer): -2,147,483,648 bits
- INT MAX (the maximum value for an integer): +2,147,483,647 bits
- UINT MAX (the maximum value for an unsigned integer): 4,294,967,295 bits
- UINT MAX + 1 = ?
- UINT MAX + 2 = ?
- UINT MAX + 3 = ?

In C/C++, overflows of **signed integer** will cause **undefined behavior** but overflows of unsigned integer will not. The resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo to the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type (modulo power of two, i.e., 2*<sup>n</sup>* where *n* is No. of bits).

Compilers may exploit undefined behavior and optimize when there is an overflow of a signed integer, producing code that you may not want!

Compilers may exploit undefined behavior and optimize when there is an overflow of a signed integer, producing code that you may not want!

```
1 signed int x ;
2 if(x > x + 1) // incorrect way to detect overflow
3 {
4 // handle potential overflow
5 }
                                                      1 signed int x ;
                                                      2 if (x > INT_MAX - 1) { // correct way
                                                      3 // handle potential overflow
                                                      4 }
```
The above is an incorrect way to detect integer overflow. x is a signed integer, and x + 1 overflows (e.g., x = INT MAX), which is undefined. The compiler is allowed to do anything, e.g., optimize away the branch, produce incorrect results, or crash.

### **Integer Overflows (A Vulnerable Example)**

```
1 int nresp = packet_get_int();
2
3 if (nresp > 0) {
4 response = xmalloc(nresp*sizeof(char*));
5
6 for (i = 0; i < nresp; i++)
7 response[i] = packet_get_string(NULL);
8 }
```
Do we have a bug in the above code? If so, where is the bug?

Do we have a bug in the above code? If so, where is the bug?

- An integer overflow that leads to a buffer overflow found in an older version of OpenSSH (3.3):
- If nresp is greater than or equal to 1073741824 and sizeof(char\*) is 4 (which is typical of 32-bit systems), then nresp\*sizeof(char\*) results in an overflow. Therefore, xmalloc() receives and allocates a small buffer. The subsequent loop causes a heap buffer overflow, which may, in turn, be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### **Integer Overflows (A Secure Example)**

```
1 int nresp = packet_get_int();
2 assert(nresp < userDefinedSize);
3 if (nresp > 0) {
4 response = xmalloc(nresp*sizeof(char*));
5
6 for (i = 0; i < nresp; i++)
7 response[i] = packet_get_string(NULL);
8 }
```
Make sure the size received is under a user budget.

5 response = xmalloc(nresp*sizeof(char*));
6
7 for (i = 0; i < nresp; i++)
8 response[i] = packet_get_string(NULL);

```
Make sure the malloc can safely allocate memory under a user budget.

### **Division by Zero (A Vulnerable Example)**

The product divides a value by zero. The C standard (C11 6.5.5) states that dividing by zero has undefined behavior for either integer or floating-point operands. It can cause program crash or miscompilation by compilers.

```
1 unsigned computeAverageResponseTime (unsigned totalTime, unsigned numRequests)
2 {
3 return totalTime / numRequests;
4 }
```

4 ParseMsg((LOGIN_MSG_BODY *)pMsg);

### **Code Injection (A Vulnerable Example)**

Code injection is the exploitation of a computer bug that is caused by processing invalid data. The result of successful code injection can be disastrous, for example, by disclosing confidential information.

 string user\_id, command; command = "cat user\_info/"; cin >> user\_id; // user\_id is an integer system(command + user\_id);

Is the above code secure?

 string user\_id, command; command = "cat user\_info/"; cin >> user\_id; // user\_id is an integer system(command + user\_id);

Is the above code secure?

- Before system(), we did not check the legality of user id. first, if x is a piece of dangerous code, it will be executed in system() and return harmful results.
- For example, if user types "05 && ipconfig", it will disclose ip address.

### **Code Injection (A Secure Example)**

To detect the bug, we need to make sure after appending \$user id will not generate another command.

```
1 string user_id, command;
2 command = "cat user_info/";
3 cin>>user_id; // what if user input "05 && ipconfig"
4 assert(isdigit(user id));
5 system(command + user_id);
```
In the assert call, we should check whether user id consists entirely of numeric characters, so that another malicious command would not be injected.

The Format String exploit occurs when the submitted data of an input string is evaluated as a command by the application.

```
1 #include <stdio.h>
2 void main(int argc, char **argv){ // assuming at least two arguments (argc > 1)
3 printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
4 printf(argv[1]);
5 }
```

2 void main(int argc, char **argv){ // assuming at least two arguments (argc > 1)
3 printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
4 printf(argv[1]);
5 }
```
- The line printf("%s", argv[1]); is safe, if you compile the program and run it:
	- ./example "Hello World %s%s%s%s%s%s"

```
- The line printf("%s", argv[1]); is safe, if you compile the program and run it:

```
1 #include <stdio.h>
2 void main(int argc, char **argv){
3 printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
4 printf(argv[1]);
5 }
```
- The line printf(argv[1]); in the example is vulnerable
- ./example "Hello World %s%s%s%s%s%s"
- Output: program crash.
- The printf in the second line will interpret the %s%s%s%s%s%s in the input string as a reference to string pointers. It will try to interpret every %s as a pointer to a string, which will get to an invalid address, and attempting to access it will likely cause the program to crash

```
1 #include <stdio.h>
2 void main(int argc, char **argv){
3 printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
4 printf(argv[1]);
5 }
```
- It can be more than a crash! An attacker can also use this to get information. For example, running: ./example "Hello World %p %p %p %p %p %p"
- First printf output: Hello World %p %p %p %p %p %p
- Second printf output: Hello World 000E133E 000E133E 0057F000 CCCCCCCC CCCCCCCC CCCCCCCC
- Causing possible memory address leakage and exploit

### **SQL Injection (A Vulnerable Example)**

The attacker can add additional SQL statements at the end of the query statements defined in advance (e.g., in the web application).

```
1 txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
2 txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
```
Is the above code vulnerable? Why?

### **SQL Injection (A Vulnerable Example)**

```
1 txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
2 txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
```

```
Is the above code vulnerable? Why?
```
- The original purpose of the code was to create an SQL statement to select a user, with a given user id.
- If there is nothing to prevent a user from entering "wrong" input, the user can enter some "smart" input like this: "105 OR 1=1".
- "OR 1==1" will make logical expression after WHERE always true. Then the sql database will return all the items from the Users table.

### **SQL Injection(A Secure Example)**

To detect the bug, we need to verify the user's input.

```
1 txtUserId = "105 OR 1=1";
2 assert(isdigit(txtUserId));
3 txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
```
Assuming that user id is an integer, we should assert the user's input is exactly an integer.

### **Side-Channel Attacks (A Vulnerable Example)**

3 for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
4 if (ca[i] != cb[i])
5 return false;
6 return true;

- The above code demonstrates a typical insecure string comparison which stops testing as soon as a character doesn't match.
- Assume a computer that takes 1 ms to check each character of a password using the above function to validate passwords.
- If the attacker guesses a completely wrong password, it will take 1 ms. Once they get one character right, it takes 2 ms. Two correct characters take 3 ms, and so on.
