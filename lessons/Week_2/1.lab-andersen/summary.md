Andersen's Points-to Analysis is a static technique used to determine potential runtime targets of pointer variables in programs. It operates by generating and solving set inclusion constraints on a constraint graph, offering a balance between precision and scalability for applications like advanced program analysis, compiler optimizations, security analysis, software verification, program analysis tools, and refactoring legacy code.

The analysis is based on four key rules: Address-of assignments (ADDR), copy assignments (Copy), load operations (Load), and store operations (Store). These rules describe how pointer assignments and dereferences are translated into graph edges and propagate points-to information in the constraint graph, which consists of nodes representing pointer variables or memory objects and edges showing constraints between program variables.

The ADDR rule adds a node representing the memory object to the pointer variable's points-to set, while the Copy rule unions the source pointer's points-to set with the destination pointer's points-to set. The Load rule adds copy edges from each object in the source pointer's points-to set to the destination pointer if those edges do not already exist in the graph, and the Store rule does the opposite for the Store operation.

The solving phase of Andersen's analysis involves a fixed-point algorithm that iteratively applies these rules to the constraint graph until no more changes occur, accurately propagating points-to information across data structures. The algorithm initializes a constraint graph based on the four rules and handles ADDR edges by maintaining a worklist of variables whose points-to sets have changed. It then iteratively processes the worklist, updating the points-to sets for each variable based on outgoing edges (COPY, LOAD, STORE) and adding affected variables to the worklist if necessary. This process continues until the worklist is empty.

An illustrative example using the four rules was provided to demonstrate how the algorithm handles pointer assignments in a simple pseudo-code example. The constraint graph helps visualize memory location propagation through pointer assignments, making it easier to understand and implement aliasing information. Andersen's analysis is significant for compiler optimizations, program verification, and security analysis.
